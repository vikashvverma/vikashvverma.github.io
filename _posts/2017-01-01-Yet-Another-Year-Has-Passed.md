Yet another year has passed and new year has come. I am kinda wondering how fruitful the year passed was.

Well, there is nothing called absolute and you need a frame of reference in order to measure something.

So how to evaluate the year passed. I'm thinking of comparing it with the year before the last year or may be with all the years passed.
